        <h1>FWI Prediction Project</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Himesh, an aspiring machine learning and deep learning enthusiast. This is my first machine learning project, where I aim to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using various meteorological parameters. The FWI is a vital tool for assessing fire danger levels, and this project enhances my skills in data analysis and predictive modeling.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
            The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the FWI based on inputs such as Temperature, Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Speed (Ws), Rain, Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), Classes, and Region. The data is processed and fed into a machine learning algorithm to make predictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Technologies Used:</strong><br>
            - Python<br>
            - Flask (for the web application)<br>
            - Scikit-learn (for building and evaluating the machine learning model)<br>
            - HTML & CSS (for front-end design)
        </p>
        <p>
            This project not only showcases my understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts but also serves as a stepping stone towards more complex and impactful projects in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to explore the application and see the FWI predictions in action. Thank you for visiting!
